# Logic-and-Language-Final-Project
In this project, we explore possibilities of performing Natural Language Inference with CCG, Lambda Calculus and First Order Logic.

The file "MAIN" contains the main jupyter notebook file, which may serve as a demonstration purpose. It also displays the statistics in terms of accuracy of our solution.

We recommend you to run our code on Google Colab. 

To run the code, you need to download this folder and upload it to your google drive. Than open the "MAIN.ipynb" file and run all the blocks.  The value of 'path'(in the second block) should be the path of this folder in your google drive.

[You can also use the shared link to access the folder directly in google drive.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-Osu8aqVpO4HJ4qqgSx8pLsHmOVonNTB?usp=sharing)
